## The process

As soon as the CFP closes we will start with the blind-voting process to pick the talks. Blind voting means, that we will select the topics only by title and abstract.

This guarantees a fair progress to everbody whether you are a super hero on stage or a first-time speaker.

The poll will run by the organisers and people from the Community to ensure diverse and balanced results.
