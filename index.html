The venue BOLLE FESTSÃ„LE is located next to the beautiful river Spree, close to Bellevue palace and Tiergarten. A bunch of one-day workshops are planned for August 29 which can be booked separately.

    We want to create an open, diverse and welcoming conference with  fantastic speakers and a warm and friendly environment. Barista coffee and childcare are just a few topics we want to offer.

    If you are interested to become a sponsor, we appreciate if you get in touch with us.
